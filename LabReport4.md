3. Step three: Keys pressed: `cd lab7`, `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *. java`, `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests`. My first command changed directories into `lab7` then my second command compiled all java files and then my last command ran all tests.

The first three up presses was to reach command `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` that was three up in my command history. The second three up was to reach command `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests` which was three up in my command history.
